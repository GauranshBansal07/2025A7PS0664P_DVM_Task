DVM Task

There's one main py file (the one that's to be executed, main.py) and 4 other helping python files which contain the code to 
loading the csv files (loading.py), the code to the shortest path and it's fare (path.py), the code to everything to with tickets
(the way the ticket is supposed to look, line change instructions and such, ticket.py) and lastly the code for everything to do 
with stations (the code stores stations' names, the lines it belongs to, and provides methods to add lines and list all stations)

The main file (main.py) runs the main program, it loads station and line data, lets users list stations, buy tickets, view 
purchased tickets, and handles all user interactions.
